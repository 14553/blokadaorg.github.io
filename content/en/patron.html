<h3>Become a Patron</h3>
<p>If you enjoy Blokada and want to support its development, becoming a Patron is a great way to do so! Your website will be promoted to every user of Blokada.</p>

<h4>Criteria</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Your website cannot contain any content deemed unsuitable by the Blokada community.</li>
<li>Your website cannot be visually obtrusive, bloated or load slowly. It has to use TLS.</li>
<li>Consider the fact Blokada community does not like advertisement. You should generally only promote products and services for good cause and/or beneficial for the community.</li>
<li>You should make a donation of sufficient amount. Offering services or freebies for the project and/or the community may also be accepted instead.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>How to apply?</h4>
<p><ol>
<li>Send your application to <a href="mailto:hello@blokada.org">hello@blokada.org</a> explaining why you should be chosen as a Patron. Include the name of website you would like to promote.</li>
<li>You will get a response promptly.</li>
<li>If accepted, your application will be included in the next voting of the Blokada community.</li>
<li>Blokada users vote for new Patron once a month. If you win the vote, you are in!</li>
</ol></p>

<h4>Where will my website be displayed?</h4>
<p>Your website will be prominently promoted in a screen displayed once for every new user, and once after every app update, just after opening Blokada. This guarantees that every impression is having user attention.</p>
