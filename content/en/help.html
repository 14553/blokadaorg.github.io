<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><b><a name="1">How does it work?</a></b><br/>Blokada is a thin layer between the network interface (wifi or mobile) of your phone and the application/s you use. To be able to filter every outgoing traffic, it generates a VPN connection and simply blocks any requests towards the hosts defined in the blacklist filters. This blocking is done with a redirection, the IP address of the website which serves the advertisement will be resolved by the phone to a local IP address (127.0.0.1), where no web service is running, therefore nothing will be shown. With this, Blokada saves both your data plan and battery life. The filters are updated automatically and contain hosts known for serving ads, tracking, spam, malware, and other unwanted or dangerous content. You can configure Blokada with your own custom filters and whitelists to ensure the service which you would like to use isn’t blocked and you don’t experience any interruption.</p>

<p><b><a name=“2”>Can I use another VPN while Blokada is turned on?</a></b><br/>Unfortunately no. You can have only one VPN connection at a time, if you join to an other service, Blokada will exit.

<p><b><a name=“3”>Can Blokada see my private content?</a></b><br/>No. Blokada does not read or tamper with your private information. Blokada only monitors which hosts your device is making requests towards and blocks the ones matching the filters. Every time Blokada blocks anything, you will see a notification (which you can turn off). Blokada has no access to your encrypted trafic.</p>

<p><b><a name=“4”>Is Blokada battery efficient?</a></b><br/>Yes. We are putting great effort to minimise the battery impact, and on most new devices, especially on Marshmallow (Android 6) or newer, you will see minimal to no battery drain. However, because of limitations on older Android versions and device fragmentation, KitKat (Android 4) users in particular, as well as users with some unlucky devices may experience increased battery drain. Refer to our <a href="http://go.blokada.org/dev_blacklist_devices">Devices Database</a> for details. Your feedback may help us improve performance on your device!</p>

<p><b><a name=“5”>Will Blokada slow down my device?</a></b><br/>No. We put great care into making Blokada as efficient as possible. In fact, both your device's performance and battery life may visibly improve, because Blokada saves your device from downloading and processing content you don't need or care about. However, users with some older devices may experience performance drop. Refer to our <a href="http://go.blokada.org/dev_blacklist_devices">Devices Database</a> for details, and give us feedback about your experience, so we can improve it!</p>

<p><b><a name=“6”>How do I report a problem?</a></b><br/>If you are experiencing problems, just choose the <b>Report a bug</b> option from the menu in top right corner. Alternatively, create an issue in our <a href="http://go.blokada.org/dev_issues">issue tracker</a>. You can also comment on any existing issues - the more information we get, the sooner we can fix the problem. Make sure to mention your device model and Android version. Finally, you could just send us an email to <a href="mailto:hello@blokada.org">hello@blokada.org</a>.</p>

<p><b><a name=“7”>What are the options in Blokada?</a></b><br/>The following options are available in Blokada:<br>
- Blacklist: lists of host files containing the hosts to block. Please note that using multiple lists can have effect on network- and system speed.<br>
- Whitelist: here you can define hosts which should not be blocked or apps where Blokada won’t filter URLs. Blokada is installed with 2 whitelisted apps, the Google Play Store and the Gmail.<br> 
- Keep alive: this option is to ensure Blokada is not paused or stopped by the system. Please note your system can overwrite it, make sure your settings will let Blokada run in the background.<br>
- Notifications: when enabled, you will be notified when an ad is blocked.<br>
- Online only: when enabled, Blokada will always run in the background, even if no network is available. If it is set to off, Blokada will exit if there is no active connection.<br>
- Start on boot: when enabled, Blokada will start after the system boots up. Please note there are system level configurations for this option, therefore it cannot be guaranteed Blokada can start on boot. In this case, please check your phone’s settings.<br>
