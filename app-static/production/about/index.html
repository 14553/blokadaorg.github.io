<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><b>How does it work?</b><br/>Blokada simply blocks any requests towards blacklisted hosts defined in filters. It means that your device will not even try to download unwanted content, saving both your data plan and battery life. Filters are updated automatically and contain hosts known for serving ads, tracking, spam, malware, and other unwanted or dangerous content.</p>

<p><b>Can Blokada see my private content?</b><br/>No. Blokada does not read or tamper with your private information. Blokada only monitors which hosts your device is making requests towards and blocks the ones matching the filters. Every time Blokada blocks anything, you will see a notification (which you can turn off).</p>

<p><b>How to enable Blokada?</b><br/>Swipe left and tap on the big shield in the middle of the screen. Gray shield means Blokada is disabled. Animating shield means Blokada is starting and soon will be active. Orange shield means Blokada is active and functioning properly. You will also see a key icon on the top of your device's screen whenever Blokada protection is on.</p>

<p><b>How to disable Blokada?</b><br/>Swipe left and tap on the big shield in the middle of the screen and wait until it becomes gray. When disabled, Blokada unloads itself from your device's memory. No filtering is performed and there is no impact on your device's performance or battery life.</p>

<p><b>Will Blokada slow down my device?</b><br/>No. We care about performance and battery life of your device as much as you do. We put great care into making Blokada as efficient as possible. In fact, both your device's performance and battery life may visibly improve, because Blokada saves your device from downloading and processing content you don't need or care about.</p>

<p><b>Why Blokada doesn't start on my device?</b><br/>Unfortunately older Android devices have several known issues related to the technology Blokada is using to perform the blocking. Try restarting your device. If you are still experiencing problems, please contact us and we will help you.</p>
