This is a feature release that introduces a new optimised blocking mechanism with:<br/><br/>

- Decreased battery usage<br/>
- Improved performance (no impact on connection bandwidth or ping)<br/>
- Higher reliability (more apps and devices work just fine with it)<br/>
- IPv6 support<br/>
- Significant stability improvements<br/><br/>

The new mechanism requires Android 5 or newer and is enabled by default. For older devices, the old mechanism is used instead.<br/><br/>

Additionally, this release fixes many bugs and problems:<br/><br/>

- Fixed dissapearing blacklist / whitelist entries<br/>
- Improved Auto Start, Keep Alive and general app stability<br/>
- Fixed several reported bugs and crashes<br/>
- Added a possibility to whitelist hosts directly from blocking notifications
