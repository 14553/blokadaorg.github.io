This is a feature release that introduces a new optimised blocking mechanism with:

- Decreased battery usage
- Improved performance (no impact on connection bandwidth or ping)
- Higher reliability (more apps and devices work just fine with it)
- IPv6 support
- Significant stability improvements

The new mechanism requires Android 5 or newer and is enabled by default. For older devices, the old mechanism is used instead.

Additionally, this release fixes many bugs and problems:

- Fixed dissapearing blacklist / whitelist entries
- Improved Auto Start, Keep Alive and general app stability
- Fixed several reported bugs and crashes
- Added a possibility to whitelist hosts directly from blocking notifications
